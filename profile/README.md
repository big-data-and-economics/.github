# Data Science For Economists

Welcome to ECON/DCS 368 Data Science for Economists, a cross-listed data science course at Bates College. The course emphasizes the "nuts and bolts" of data science that economists need to know to be successful empirical researchers.

The class materials repository is a great place to start if you're interested! 

## Note: 
The name of this course was changed in 2024. The GitHub Organization will be changed in the near future, but needs to be done between semesters to protect student access. Apologies for the mistaken identity!
